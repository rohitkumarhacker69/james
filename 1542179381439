Karan Awasthi Sir
Fantastic jobs on the Animation projects people.
Each and everyone(lolz) has done a fine job at creating a minute of conceptual Animation and that' commendable.
Screening will be a blast !

Wednesday we're all quickly finishing up the scenes and focusing on the credits and the extras which includes your sound,music and other effects.

If you feel you have enough time and energy to tackle an animated opening credit by all means go for it.

Do compare your work with those of your colleagues. That's healthy competition and it's critical for the success of the class as a whole.

Don't let it drain you or get discouraged with your own product. We all come with unique skills, as gifts. Appreciate the fact that 4 weeks ago u didn't know Adobe Animate or what Animation was and where you stand today.

I want you all to be proud of whatever you create. Even if it's a line. I create anxiety in students and I love it.

On a side note, a heartfelt thank you for the beautiful feedback that I got from you guys. I've said it before it's half you half me all the way. You've been awesome students.

Finish up the animations and make them look good otherwise I'll make ur marks look very bad.üï∫

Skype sessions mandatory for everyone till Thursday night.

Friday Submissions 12pm sharp.
Hahahahahahaha.lolz
